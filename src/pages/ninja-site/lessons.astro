      <h2>Project setup and structure</h2>

      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>
          <strong>Tool Evaluation Strategy:</strong>
          Choose tools closest to the framework’s ecosystem over feature-rich but distant alternatives.
          <a href="https://github.com/vite-pwa/astro">@vite-pwa/astro</a> was the most feature-rich
          <abbr title="Progressive Web App">PWA</abbr> option but chosen because <a href="https://vite.dev/">Vite</a> is core to
          <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>, ensuring long-term support over simpler alternatives like
          <a href="https://github.com/alextim/astro-lib/tree/main/packages/astro-webmanifest">astro-webmanifest</a> or
          <a href="https://github.com/aondodawid/WebApp-Astro-PWA">webapp-astro-pwa</a> with maintenance or popularity concerns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Configuration Format Evolution:</strong>
          Linting tools have frequently changed configuration formats; both <a href="https://stylelint.io/">Stylelint</a> and
          <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> evolved from <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> to
          <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> and will hopefully include <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> soon.
          TypeScript configurations avoid mixing JavaScript files and provide better editor support, though many plugins still lack
          TypeScript support and documentation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Linting Configuration Approach:</strong>
          Start with all linting rules enabled by default, then selectively customize based on project conflicts and preferences. Adding
          standards to an existing project is more difficult than lowering them. Starting with strict rules then customizing ensures maximum
          code quality while maintaining development efficiency.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shareable Configuration Management:</strong>
          Maintaining multiple copies of linter configurations across personal and professional projects becomes unsustainable as tools
          evolve. Implementing shareable configurations eliminates duplication and centralizes maintenance; a future project to research and
          implement now that configurations are code-based rather than JSON.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Documentation Organization:</strong>
          Separate documentation files with cross-linking work better than monolithic README files for complex projects. Scanning document
          filenames provides better overview than maintaining table of contents in single files.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Framework Migration Strategy:</strong>
          Astro requires React-like thinking patterns despite being different from <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a>. Moving existing
          code to temporary folders alongside framework templates enables side-by-side comparison during migration, clarifying structural
          differences and preventing loss of working implementations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="description">
        <p>
          I found during tool evaluation that ecosystem proximity often matters more than features. @vite-pwa/astro integration was selected
          because it’s maintained by the Vite which is core to Astro’s architectural patterns. Manual
          <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> tag implementation avoided configuration complexity while providing exactly
          the needed functionality without unused features.
        </p>

        <p>
          Configuration format changes in linting tools require ongoing maintenance, particularly when plugin ecosystems lag behind core
          tool updates. TypeScript configuration support varies significantly across plugins, with some providing excellent type safety
          while others require guesswork and trial-and-error configuration approaches. This inconsistency makes plugin evaluation more
          time-consuming but necessary for maintenance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Managing configurations across multiple projects highlighted the need for shareable configurations. With linting configurations
          now code-based rather than JSON, implementing shareable configurations should leverage familiar programming concepts for easier
          maintenance and distribution.
        </p>

        <p>
          Documentation structure affects both discoverability and maintenance overhead. Single large files become difficult to navigate and
          update, while well-organized separate files with clear naming conventions improve both developer experience and documentation
          maintenance.

      <h2>Developing the website</h2>

      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>
          <strong>Framework Selection Process:</strong>
          Learning to identify the correct tool for specific requirements rather than defaulting to popular choices. Astro and Custom
          Elements were chosen together for static sites with minimal interactivity, works well enough without framework overhead designed
          for complex application state management.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Documentation Priority:</strong>
          Writing flexible code requires documenting the “why” for future maintainability. Code will inevitably have different requirements
          and additional interconnections, so documenting reasoning and writing automated tests ensures stability and prevents difficult
          future changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security vs Performance Trade-offs:</strong>
          Default to security when faced with genuine trade-offs, trusting that performance improvements occur over time while security
          typically degrades without active maintenance. Pursue both when possible, accepting trade-offs only when genuine conflicts exist.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Framework Concerns:</strong>
          Styling frameworks like <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and
          <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" title="Tailwind CSS">Tailwind</a> can prevent developers from understanding CSS fundamentals
          and cascade behavior. Too many web developers try to avoid writing CSS rather than embracing the cascade and understanding
          encapsulation patterns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Developer Skill Gaps:</strong>
          The separation between developers who avoid CSS and designers who avoid code creates problematic gaps. More developers should
          understand design implementation, and more designers should understand CSS and componentization principles.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="description">
        <p>
          <abbr title="Single Page Application">SPA</abbr>s aren’t ideal for public websites meant to be indexed by search engines. Adding
          <abbr title="Server-Side Rendering">SSR</abbr> to facilitate both performance and non-JavaScript web crawlers is generally a heavy
          task. Next.js with React or <a href="https://angular.dev/">Angular</a> are beasts that should be used in appropriately complex
          systems where they are required, not as default choices for simple sites.
        </p>

        <p>
          Documentation purpose, reasoning, and decision making for all projects: solo ones because you cannot remember everything anymore,
          and team ones because team members will change and the scope will be so wide that no one developer can keep it all in their head.
          It boils down to the same thing: you cannot know everything. Documenting the reasoning behind technical decisions enables
          confident modifications when requirements change or new features are needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Security-first decision making worked because performance optimizations continue improving through tool updates and hardware
          advancement, while security posture tends to degrade over time without active maintenance. The PWA implementation exemplified
          pursuing both objectives without compromise.
        </p>

        <p>
          Styling framework concerns reflect a broader issue where developers avoid learning fundamental web technologies. Understanding CSS
          cascade behavior and proper encapsulation techniques provides better long-term solutions than utility-based approaches that
          abstract away the underlying platform. Everyone should be attempting to learn new skills, maintain existing ones, and keep up to
          date with development trends; not doing so is a recipe for becoming irrelevant.

      <h2>Deployment and infrastructure</h2>

      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>
          <strong>Infrastructure as Code Limitations:</strong>
          Infrastructure providers and <abbr title="Infrastructure as Code">IaC</abbr> tools update rapidly, requiring constant maintenance.
          Workarounds also need documentation so projects can progress while adapting when updates open new solution possibilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Infrastructure Maintenance Scheduling:</strong>
          Run <code>terraform plan</code> quarterly to identify configuration drift before it becomes unmanageable. Proactive maintenance
          prevents infrastructure technical debt accumulation and avoids extensive catch-up scenarios when urgent changes are needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tool Mismatch Recognition:</strong>
          <a href="https://parceljs.org/">Parcel</a> wasn’t a good fit for my static website, requiring too much customization and fighting
          against the tool’s priorities. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="AWS S3">S3</a>/<a
            href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/"
            title="AWS CloudFront"
          >CloudFront</a> limitations for directory index files showed <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> priorities don’t align
          with basic static file server expectations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Service Focus Alignment:</strong>
          Static Site Generation isn’t <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/">AWS Amplify</a>’s primary focus, but SPA requirements
          largely overlap with static website needs, providing reasonable future compatibility. Recognition that tools may not perfectly
          match use cases but can still be viable solutions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="description">
        <p>
          Infrastructure as Code limitations highlight the challenge of managing rapidly evolving cloud services through automation tools.
          The race between infrastructure providers, IaC tools, and users creates constant maintenance overhead. Documenting bugs and
          workarounds enables project progress while maintaining the ability to adapt when better solutions become available.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started scheduling infrastructure maintenance after client projects where stable infrastructure required extensive updates
          before adding new features. Quarterly <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform">Terraform</a> planning catches provider
          updates, deprecated resources, and configuration drift before they compound into major upgrade projects, saving significant time
          compared to reactive infrastructure updates.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tool selection requires understanding that perfect matches rarely exist. Parcel’s focus on application bundling conflicted with
          static site requirements, while S3/CloudFront’s enterprise focus doesn’t prioritize basic static file server functionality.
          Amplify provides adequate functionality despite different primary objectives because SPA and static site requirements overlap.

      <h2>General development principles</h2>

      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>
          <strong>Simplicity Principle:</strong>
          The correct tool is often the simplest; either to write, test, or maintain. Limited ability to predict future requirements means
          choosing flexible solutions over feature-rich ones that may not match actual needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flexibility Through Documentation:</strong>
          True flexibility comes from documenting the “why” behind code decisions so future modifications can be made confidently. Code will
          inevitably require different requirements and interconnections with new systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Feature Addition Restraint:</strong>
          Don’t add features that aren’t necessary unless trivial to implement. Premature optimization and feature addition create
          maintenance overhead without providing immediate value.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Predictable Investment Areas:</strong>
          Some investments reliably pay dividends: comprehensive test coverage, clear documentation, and robust error handling. These areas
          can be prioritized because they consistently reduce future development friction.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="description">
        <p>
          The simplicity principle came from recognizing that predicting future requirements remains challenging despite experience.
          Stakeholder and user responses to projects often surprise developers, making flexibility more valuable than feature completeness.
          Simple solutions typically adapt better to changing requirements than complex ones optimized for specific scenarios.
        </p>

        <p>
          Documentation and testing represent reliable investments because code modification requirements are predictable even when specific
          changes aren’t. Comprehensive test coverage ensures that future changes don’t introduce regressions, while clear documentation
          enables confident modifications when context has been lost over time.
