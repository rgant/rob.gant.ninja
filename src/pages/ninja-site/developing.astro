          <strong>Intersection Observer Configuration:</strong>
          Used <code>rootMargin: '-20% 0px -80%'</code> which counterintuitively results a 1-pixel height observation area that ensures only
          one section can have <code>isIntersecting: true</code> at any time, preventing multiple navigation items from activating
          simultaneously. The -20% top margin positions the observation area about one-fifth down the viewport for smoother navigation
          transitions.

          <strong><abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> Encapsulation:</strong>

      <div class="description">
        <p>
          For a static website with minimal interactive requirements, JavaScript frameworks introduce unnecessary complexity and bundle
          size. Native Custom Elements work well enough while keeping the DOM and logic co-located, improving maintainability and reducing
          the complexity of managing framework-specific patterns for simple interactions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The career experience component uses progressive enhancement by serving static calculation in the initial HTML for non-JavaScript
          environments while automatically updating to current calculations when JavaScript executes. This approach ensures the content
          remains functional and informative regardless of JavaScript availability while providing enhanced accuracy when possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          The scroll navigation feature existed in the previous
          <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://parceljs.org/" target="_blank">Parcel</a>-based website using
          <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>
          scroll events. While scroll events weren’t actually problematic for this simple single-page site, migrating to Intersection
          Observer provided better performance characteristics and follows current practices. Typical Intersection Observer implementations
          for this type of feature watch for heading elements, but mine triggers on any part of the section content instead.
        </p>

        <p>
          Configuring the Intersection Observer required understanding that <code>rootMargin</code> syntax differs from
          <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> margin properties, where negative percentages shrink the root intersection area
          rather than expanding it. The fundamental problem with default Intersection Observer behavior for this case is that multiple
          sections can intersect simultaneously, making it impractical to identify which section should actually activate the corresponding
          navigation item. The solution ensures that only one section intersects at any time.

          The decision to implement PWA features came from learning that many developers consider them essentially free additions when using
          modern build tools. Since HTML5 Boilerplate had already included a manifest file that went unused, researching PWA implementation
          revealed minimal effort required for performance improvements.

          The
          <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/vite-pwa/astro/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">vite-pwa examples</a>
          demonstrate practically every available option but lack clear explanations of individual option purposes. Understanding the
          configuration impact required checking both
          <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/guide/" target="_blank">Vite PWA documentation</a> and
          <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/" target="_blank">official Workbox docs</a>
          alongside example configurations.
        </p>

        <p>
          While PWA features aren’t required for basic static websites, they represent necessary infrastructure for modern web applications.
          Implementing them on a simple site provides familiarity with the tooling and patterns that will be essential for more complex
          projects requiring offline capabilities and enhanced performance characteristics.

        <!-- TODO: Link to this section from brainfry-app (Angular) when that section is written -->
        <p>
          Security analysis tools and Angular’s improved support motivated the CSP implementation. Rather than implementing relaxed rules
          that provide minimal security benefits, the strict approach with SRI hashes provides meaningful protection against code injection
          attacks, even for static sites with limited server-side functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
          SRI hash integration was the primary technical challenge, specifically how to inject dynamically generated hashes into
          <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> response headers managed by
          <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/" target="_blank">AWS Amplify</a>. The @kindspells/astro-shield tool
          handles hash computation effectively, but requires custom scripting to export hashes in
          <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> format for
          <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform" target="_blank">Terraform</a>
          consumption, as detailed in the
          <a href="deploy.html">deployment</a> process.
        </p>

        <p>
          Disabling asset inlining eliminates potential security vulnerabilities where inline resources could bypass CSP restrictions. The
          performance cost of additional HTTP requests proved negligible compared to the security boundary benefits, particularly when
          pursuing comprehensive security analysis tool compliance. The goal of achieving clean security reports from analysis tools
          justified the trade-off between minimal performance costs and enhanced security posture.

        <p>
          Astro’s TypeScript-first approach eliminates the configuration overhead typically associated with adding TypeScript to JavaScript
          frameworks. The build process integration between multiple tools requires minimal coordination beyond ensuring SRI hash
          computation happens after all asset optimization and PWA manifest generation completes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Vite development server provides better performance than previous build tool experiences, explaining why frameworks like
          Angular are migrating to Vite-based development servers. The hot reload functionality works reliably with the TypeScript and
          Custom Elements combination without requiring special configuration.
        </p>

        <p>
          While Astro Islands provide powerful partial hydration capabilities for framework components, the lack of direct Custom Elements
          support represents a missed opportunity for developers preferring native web technologies over framework dependencies. This
          limitation doesn’t affect functionality but prevents leveraging Astro’s selective hydration optimizations for Custom Elements.

        <li>
          <strong>Optimal Strategy:</strong>
          Pursue both security and performance when possible, accepting trade-offs only when genuine conflicts exist between requirements.

      </ul>

      <div class="description">
        <p>
          The framework selection process shows why of matching tools to specific requirements rather than defaulting to popular choices.
          For a static site with minimal interactivity, Custom Elements works well enough without the overhead and complexity of larger
          frameworks designed for complex application state management.
        </p>

        <p>
          The security-first approach when facing trade-offs reflects the reality that performance optimizations continue improving through
          tool updates and hardware advancement, while security posture tends to degrade over time without active maintenance. This
          perspective influenced decisions like disabling asset inlining and implementing strict CSP policies despite minimal performance
          costs.
        </p>

        <p>
          When genuine conflicts between security and performance requirements don’t exist, pursuing both objectives simultaneously produces
          superior outcomes. The PWA implementation demonstrates this approach by providing both security benefits through manifest
          configuration and performance improvements through resource precaching without compromising either objective.
