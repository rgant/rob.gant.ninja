# Terraform for AWS static website hosting

## Update Dynamic IPs

Set the `check_ip` variable to true to update the dynamic IPs:

```sh
terraform plan -var="check_ip=true"
```

The default is `false` and will lookup the existing IP from DNS for the home network.
This is to avoid causing 429 "Too Many Requests" responses from `my-ip.io`
